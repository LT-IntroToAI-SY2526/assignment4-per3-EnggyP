# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Personally, the most difficult part was making the move on tic toc toe. I wasn't sure how to create the function. I was able to create the board correctly, but making the rest was confusing for me, such as on how to program the function to move 'X' or 'O' and insert it onto the board.  


2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would add a computer player to the game by create a function that defines computer_move and I would call that function instead of asking for its user input. Adding onto that function I would create a new asserts and list of strings that will assist the computer to know where they know where to move, such as moving to an empty space automatically.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I would add a list of possible or a variety of different placement combos for winnings when they are playing as "X" or "O". This would help the computer see which moves it should take and give it the best chance of winning. So it would become unbeatable since it would always run through the data and seeing the smartest move available.
